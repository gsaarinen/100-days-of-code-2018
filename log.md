# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: January 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Things I covered today:

- [x] Fixed the Node version issues I was having with deploying to Heroku
- [x] Started playing around with the new Smartsheet gem and the Ruby SDK
- [x] Added a bunch of fake data and counters to the aggregate components in the React app

**Time Logged:**

2.5

**Thoughts:**

Super excited about Smartsheet having a [Ruby gem](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk) now! This will make it a lot easier to start playing around with it at work and allow me to potentially write some code for my job.

Also, starting to get this React Spotify thing off the ground and it's nice to be learning more about React. It's really different though to have everything for a web page be in one file (styling, html, and JS).

### Day 5: January 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Continued work on the DevTips Tutorial - [React JS Prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3bRdvmTdwQ). Had to skip yesterday ðŸ˜¬

A few other things that I worked on:
- [x] Got `git` setup
- [x] Got `heroku` setup

**Time Logged:**

1.75 hrs

**Thoughts:**

Had some issues with getting the repo to build on Heroku. I found [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/troubleshooting-node-deploys) article that I need to dive into because I'm getting node version discrepancy issues.

Fun stuff! ðŸ˜Š

### Day 4: January 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Continued work on the DevTips Tutorial - [React JS Prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3bRdvmTdwQ).

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Started working on the DevTips Tutorial - [React JS Prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3bRdvmTdwQ). It's nice to FINALLY start playing around with React!

**Time Logged:**

1.15 hrs

**Thoughts:**

I know that I'm kind of jumping around right now with things I'm working on but it feels good to just get some exposure to some different technologies. Front-end frameworks like React are a bit of a hole in my knowledge so spending some time on getting to know how they work feels like a good move.

-----------------------------

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Building an Alexa Skill.
- learned about AWS Lambdas
- how to host and setup and Alexa Skill
- ended on [Connecting Your Voice User Interface To Your Lambda Function](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game/blob/master/instructions/3-connect-vui-to-code.md) section

Also, I'll have to install node.js and such to get this running locally.

**Time Logged:**

1.25 hrs

**Thoughts:**

Learning about Alexa skills is fun! The AWS tutorials are pretty thorough. I definitely recommend them.
