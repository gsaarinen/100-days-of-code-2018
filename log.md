# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Started working on the DevTips Tutorial - [React JS Prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3bRdvmTdwQ). It's nice to FINALLY start playing around with React!

**Time Logged:**

1.15 hrs

**Thoughts:**

I know that I'm kind of jumping around right now with things I'm working on but it feels good to just get some exposure to some different technologies. Front-end frameworks like React are a bit of a hole in my knowledge so spending some time on getting to know how they work feels like a good move.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Building an Alexa Skill.
- learned about AWS Lambdas
- how to host and setup and Alexa Skill
- ended on [Connecting Your Voice User Interface To Your Lambda Function](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game/blob/master/instructions/3-connect-vui-to-code.md) section

Also, I'll have to install node.js and such to get this running locally.

**Time Logged:**

1.25 hrs

**Thoughts:**

Learning about Alexa skills is fun! The AWS tutorials are pretty thorough. I definitely recommend them.
