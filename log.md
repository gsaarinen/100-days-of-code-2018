# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: January 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Continued work on the DevTips Tutorial - [React JS Prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3bRdvmTdwQ). Had to skip yesterday ðŸ˜¬

A few other things that I worked on:
- Got `git` setup
- Got `heroku` setup

**Time Logged:**

1.75 hrs

**Thoughts:**

Had some issues with getting the repo to build on Heroku. I found [this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/troubleshooting-node-deploys) article that I need to dive into because I'm getting node version discrepancy issues.

Fun stuff! ðŸ˜Š

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

Started working on the DevTips Tutorial - [React JS Prototyping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3bRdvmTdwQ). It's nice to FINALLY start playing around with React!

**Time Logged:**

1.15 hrs

**Thoughts:**

I know that I'm kind of jumping around right now with things I'm working on but it feels good to just get some exposure to some different technologies. Front-end frameworks like React are a bit of a hole in my knowledge so spending some time on getting to know how they work feels like a good move.

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:**

- ended on [Connecting Your Voice User Interface To Your Lambda Function](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game/blob/master/instructions/3-connect-vui-to-code.md) section

Also, I'll have to install node.js and such to get this running locally.

**Time Logged:**

**Thoughts:**

Learning about Alexa skills is fun! The AWS tutorials are pretty thorough. I definitely recommend them.
